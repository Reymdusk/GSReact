                    <ul>
                        <li>NOTE: The boss will not count DMG taken while in BREAK if you break the boss <b>BEFORE</b> the shield reveals. A good strategy is to Break the boss before the Shield comes up so you can hit it with everything you've got while he is in a BREAK state.</li>
                    </ul>

            <center><h2>Overview</h2></center>
            <center><p>Where Dungeon of Trials starts to spike in difficulty, and thus the length of the guides will reflect this. 
            F26 brings unique and challenging mechanics to tackle, 
            including the first "Field Effect" that persists throughout the battle. Very specific compositions 
            and equipment will be required for this floor and passed this floor, so a player without a developed account to 
            combat certain niches will start to struggle.</p>
            </center>
            <br />


            <br />
            <b><h2><center>Before you begin...</center></h2></b>
            <p> Proper equipment and team composition are essential for the floor. Here are some things to consider about the boss as you build up your team:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You need Status RES! Ignis gains heavily increased DMG on units that are Burned. 
                Though she only applies the ailment on Arts/HP threshold, it's essential to bring Status RES unless you want to die really quick. 
                <b>Rimuru</b> works great for this. Alternatively, you can also use an equip like <b>Ganan's Sandals</b>, <b>Mira Hood</b>, 
                and <b>Raaz/Diaz Jade</b>, though you may need to bring one or two.</li>
                <li><b>Mizuki</b> makes this floor fairly braindead to deal with. Bring her if you have her for an easy clear as she's literally made for this quest</li>
                <li><b>Evasion - </b>This boss has very high evasion that can kill your DPS. Accuracy Up is recommended if you want to clear faster, 
                but ultimately not necessary. Not bringing Accuracy Up can also serve to control your DPS preventing higher DMG reflection on your units.</li>
                <li>It's necessary to bring at least one source of Freeze as it's required to stop Ignis 
                from enraging at certain thresholds(More info below.) It can be any kind of Freeze source either 
                from Equipment or a Unit as long as it can freeze; the chance infliction does not matter.</li>
            </ul>

            <br/>
            <b><h2><center>Field Effect - Hellfire</center></h2></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Hellfire reflect 5% of the damage you deal to the unit, <b>bypassing damage reduction, 
            damage redirection, and shields</b>. In other words, complete fixed damage that can't be 
            mitigated in any way.</li>
                <li>To visualize how massive this is, a single Vox TA slash will get him 
            killed instantly. 200,000 DMG will reflect 10k DMG to him after all. Because of this field mechanic, 
            it's paramount to control your DPS efficiently so as not to get your units killed quickly. 
            Evidently, it also disallows the use of a lot of meta units that deal too much damage (Even Thetis is likely to die from one TA!) </li>
                <li>Additionally, your units will lose 20% of their MAX HP every 5s. Very potent heals are required so as not to get overtaken by this constant damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <center><img src="/db/Units/Thumbnail/unit_thumbnail_500111113.png" alt="Degilmagna" /></center>
            <p>You fight the Fire Dragon, Degilmagna, in the first stage. There isn't anything massive about this stage other 
            than it instant killing your team if you've stayed in it for too long(25s~.) Additionally, <b>Hellfire</b> will be in effect at the start of the stage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Degilmagna will <b>ONLY</b> take damage from Arts/True Arts.</li>
                <li>Degilmagna is exceedingly squishy. You can defeat him in one Arts for most units.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <p>Normal DPS isn't too severe, though as always, Hellfire will be in effect and really mess up your unit's HP. 
            Proper mitigations with the use of Shields will help to mitigate Ignis' normal damage, though don't forget to heal your units thoroughly against Hellfire!</p>

            <br />
            <b><h2><center>Thresholds and Other Mechanics:</center></h2></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Ignis will use Arts right at the start. As always, her Arts will inflict Burn, so don't forget to pop a Status RES Up so you don't get wiped.</li>
                <li>Along with her threshold nukes, Ignis will Arts as usual on a regular interval - inflicting Burn as always if not resisted with Status RES. 
                Always remember to proc at least one whenever she does!</li>
                <li>At <b>70% HP</b> - Ignis will <b>Enrage</b>, giving herself burn. This grants her heavily increased Heal over Time and Art Generation. 
                This must be canceled by hitting her with any source of Freeze ailment. It does not have to chance proc, it just has to hit.</li>
                <li>At <b>60% HP</b> - Ignis will nuke with her Arts again. Remember to proc a Status RES again to avoid getting burnt!</li>
                <li>At <b>50% HP</b> - Ignis gains increased Art Generation. Additionally, she burns herself and enrages yet again, gaining 
                increased DMG reflection on-top of other enraged buffs above if not canceled. Cancel with Freeze source as always.</li>
                <li>At <b>40% HP</b> - Ignis fills Arts Gauge to full and uses Arts. Same deal here; get some Status RES Up.</li>
                <li>At <b>30% HP</b> - Ignis self-applies Burn and enrages one more time. Freeze to cancel again. 
                Additionally, she gains a permanent DMG Up buff at this threshold.</li>
                <li>At <b>&lt;25% HP</b> - Ignis starts using her high damage Arts, Blazing Impact on a regular interval. This still inflicts burn, 
                just hurts way more. High Damage Reduction is recommended for this.</li>
                <li>At <b>10% HP</b> - Ignis fills Arts Gauge to full and uses an empowered Blazing Impact that deals much more than normal. 
                Recommended to try cancelling this my breaking her if you lack the necessary Damage Reduction to tank it. 
                There are no further thresholds after this, so just aim to defeat Ignis.</li>

            <p>Rimuru's Status RES and general team utility lets you rely less on Status RES equipment. 
            He works well in any team composition whether Mono-Water or not as long as you let him do his job.</p>
            <p><b>NOTE: Why not Feena?</b> -  Feena's heal over time is typically unable to keep up with Hellfire on her own. 
            Using a second slot for a dedicated healer to remedy this is a wasted unit slot that could have gone for better 
            team support units. Rimuru offers a diverse amount of team utility, allowing him to be slotted-in with ease without the fear of losing out on team support. 
            As such, Feena isn't a "notable" unit for the quest. Note that it can still be possible to clear with Feena, just not recommended. 
            (Especially with OP supports like Asirpa/Mako or if used in Mono-Light with Asirpa.)</p>

            <p>With very potent heals and great slots for the quest, this is the place where Aristela truly shines. 
            An extra DEF slot allows more Status RES equips, and her potent heals will essentially keep your units at 
            full 24/7 as long as you don't overdo it. A great budget pick</p>

            <p>Given enough support, these two can facetank most of Ignis' normal damage, 
            most especially when abusing their Heal Slots with revive equipment like Sounding 
            Staff and Blessed Necklace giving a great windfall if things slip up.</p>

            <p>Buffed Palamicia crest without her type-killers and more emphasis on her <b>Counterattack</b> mechanic. Disease is an absolutely essential ailment to clear the floor. 
            As usual with Palamicia bosses, her high damage Arts will necessitate barrier units and high-end Defense equipment.</p>

            <b><h2><center>Before you begin...</center></h2></b>
            <center>
            <p>Disease is paramount for this floor as Palamicia will start healing 120% of damage dealt to her at a certain point. 
            The easiest units to procure for this are either <b>Nier</b> or <b>Aesis</b>. Others units you can use are <b>Kurama</b> and <b>Alvina</b>.
            <br/>
            Other than that, there isn’t a large requirement on Defence equipment or anything else. Look out for the rest of her counterattacks and Arts and you’ll be fine.</p>

                <li>At 40% HP - Gain <span class="buffDebuff">DMG Up</span> and a slight <span class="buffDebuff">Critical Rate Up</span></li>
                <li>At 30~% HP - Gains <span class="buffDebuff">Action Speed Up</span></li>

                        <li>Due to the amount of buffs Palamicia would have at this threshold along with the temporary buffs she gets, this TA would hurt a lot.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Team compositions for this floor depend on building around your Disease inflicting unit. Both sustain and ArtsGen will be a large part of your composition; the former due to her high damage output passed 20% HP, and the latter to offset the ArtsRegen Down debuff.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A Unit that can inflict Disease is required</li>

                            <b>NOTE:</b> Though it’s important to note that <b>Nier</b> is rather difficult to keep alive due to her inherent low base health and defence!</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Barrier Units - Will prove the most useful in parallel with a healer. <b>Favelle</b> is an easily accessible barrier unit. Any other unit at a similar potency works just as well.</li>
                        <li>Arts Gen Units - Allows your team to repeatedly use their Arts quickly</li>
                    </ul>

            <center>
            <p>The Giant Boss Dragons you once knew and abused for Relics are now back for blood in the new Floor 28! 
            Mavro-halos and the boys In the new floor packs an interesting gimmick revolving around being able to kill the 
            pre-stage’ Dragons before they unleash their arts in order to gain massive HP buffs on your Team necessary 
            to survive the tough fight against Mavro Halos.</p>
            </center>
            <br/>

            <b><h2><center>Before you begin...</center></h2></b>
            <center>
            <p><b>HP%</b> heal is an absolute necessity, your Units will shoot up to 40-60k HP 
            in this stage in order to sustain the large blows of damage Mavro Halos can inflict, the typical fixed healing from Mako/Feena, 
            etc are rather insignificant in this stage.</p>
            <p><b>Arts drain</b> units are also very favorable for the 
            pre-stages to completely negate the Dragons’ Arts in order to 
            guarantee your huge HP buff. (Although not necessary as killing 
                them fast enough before they can use their Arts works too!)</p>
            <p>Having a mix of both Physical and Magic Damage is very important in order to even get 
            through the Pre-Stages, other then that 2 to 3 Defense Items are also favorable in order 
            to survive against Mavro-halos.</p>

                <li>At 60% HP - Gains <span class="buffDebuff">DMG Up</span></li>
                <li>At 50% HP - Gains a new attack. Causes <span class="buffDebuff">Hitstun</span> during duration of the attack</li>
                <li>At 40% HP - Gains <span class="buffDebuff">DMG Up</span> and <span class="buffDebuff">Action Up</span></li>
                <li>At 30% HP - Gains faster Arts Gauge speed. After this point, it's near impossible to maintain permanent Arts Drain on Mavro Halos.</li>
                <li>Below 30% HP - At this point you want to clear the stage as soon as possible due to all the deadly buffs Mavro has accumulated. Especially with his Arts Speed increase, you’re likely to be blast away by his unmitigatable Art if you’re not quick enough!</li>

            <br/>
            <b><h2><center>Strategy</center></h2></b>
            <ul>
                <li>As mentioned before, <b>HP%</b> Heals are your best friend, or else you will be inevitably 
                trampled by Mavro-halos despite your new massive amount of HP with the given Buffs. (With enough shielding and Dmg RES it’s possible to bring just HP% Heal Equipment rather then a dedicated Healer)</li>
                <li>A strong source of Artsgen is very important as well, as Mavro-halos’s Arts Drain attack can become a problem with the abundant <span class="buffDebuff">Action Speed Up</span> he gains if you’re not prepared.</li>
                <li><span class="buffDebuff">DMG Res</span> buffs are especially useful in this stage as well due to Mavro-halos inflicting no Dmg RES debuffs, Defense Equipment such as <b>Gargantua</b>, <b>Elastomer Suit</b> and <b>Spike Helmet Agni</b> and Units that can increase Dmg RES will massively help in mitigating most of it's damage.</li>
                <li>If Dmg RES items and units aren't an option for you. As mentioned before, <b>Arts Drain</b> Units will be able to help in making majority of the fight easily manageable until Mavro-halos’s final threshold.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Poison is quite strong against Raydis. <b>Pola</b> is one of the stronger DPS option for this stage due to her Poison DMG scaling with the boss' HP</li>
                <li>Bring a <b>Taunt Tank</b>. With how much the boss paralyzes and with the danger of her Arts #2, using a taunt tank such as <b>Gerald</b> is the safest option.</li>
                <li>Bring a <b>Breaker</b>. Since <b>Pola's</b> poison gets weaker the lower the boss' HP is, the end of the fight will be risky and drawn out without one. <b>Platina</b> is a safe option as she has a Defense slot, however, any will suffice.</li>
                <li>Make sure to have <span class="buffDebuff">Cleanse</span> or some form of <span class="buffDebuff">Paralyze immunity</span> ready for each Art.</li>
                <li>Take it slow. This fight doesn't have a timer and will take some time to clear, no reason to rush and risk dying!</li>

                <li>Slow ramping units outside of Luahn <b>should not</b> be used. </li>
                <li>Phase 1 is the most important with it being the only one that someone can speed up their run by more than a few seconds.</li>
                <li>Each Endless lasts for around <b>26 seconds</b>. You’ll need to deal with 4 of these so plan your time accordingly. </li>
                <li>The time layout during the phases are a rough guide made with the assumption someone will take 2 Endlesses to clear stage 3, if you can clear in 1 endless you’d have a much larger window. </li>
                <li>Only his first Endless, "Endless Z" does substantial damage, the other 3, "Endless"  are much weaker.</li>

            <b><h4><center>Stage 1 Strategy</center></h4></b>
            <p>Overall this stage is nothing to special, just make sure to clear it semi fast to limit how many stacks she applies to you. However, Make sure to delay going between her HP intervals till after the dmg res down has gone away.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Due to this boss gaining damage immunity to 3 elements you need 4 units of different elements capable of doing good damage while performing other roles. </li>
                <li>An all stats up unit such as Vox is very useful since they can perform a second function after they can't damage the boss. </li>
                <li>A tip for full clearing, have your weaker dps units get negated during the first and last interval as there's less HP to go through.</li>
