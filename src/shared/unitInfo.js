                In all seriousness, with his Awoken form Rayas is now a real unit, being able to compete with other DPS options like Swick. Although his lack of crit does hurt, he's a solid option. Stages with "clear with Rayas" requires will no longer require you to carry a dead unit. As a luck unit Rayas is still lacking though, needing to enter Ex-Force before he can TA is a very big downside when you just want to luck nuke. Also you know...there's the minor issue of how anyone who is capable of getting him awoken already has a decently developed box so not like he'll ever be used outside of those "clear with Rayas" requirements anyway.`,

Happy that her plan had succeeded, she strolled off to observe the furious battle raging on Thaumazein Plain at the peak of summer.",

The plains were frozen solid, and the rampaging flames died out. This disaster became known as the Thaumazein Winter, when the grain belt was buried in snow. The truth of what happened is recorded nowhere, but she surely doesn't mind."

When he hears rumors of the Lord running amok, a girl riding his back, he realizes he might have a chance to meet the daughter he thought dead. Yet she refuses him. His despondency was only momentary, though as a sudden Demon appeared to attack the Lord and his rider. He stood before the Demon, his true power now unleashed.",

'If you have the courage to become the forest's guardian, we will allow you to stay.'

                overall: `Before awakening, Gaia was a mitigator/shield unit that only worked to a desirable level in mono-water teams, with his NA granting the team a shield that scales up by 1000 dmg x the number of water units in the team, and one of his passives granting 10% dmg res to near-death units. His awakening gives him a TA that increases the party’s dmg res by 20% and buffs water units’ damage by 30 %. This, coupled with his two defense slots, enables Gaia to be used to substantially mitigate boss dmg. While not as airtight as what Sanstone can achieve, this is nonetheless extremely useful for new players, especially on a free farmable unit that can also serve double-duty as luck unit, or for more experienced players in water ruins (where Gaia can also provide 1 arts/s teamwide with his passive). Awoken Gaia is a unit with a narrower use, but one that can be vital in certain quests.`,

He used to teach swordsmanship and magic in his hometown, but he was thrown out due to his abnormality. He was obsessed with making his students fight each other, tossing the losers aside and making the winners fight more. He called the most skilled of his students his \"works of art.\" His masterpiece was a war orphan who grew up to become a commander of a battalion of Dragon knights.",

He played with many lives for his own entertainment and ended up being targeted by the Black Dragon Knights because of it, but it is unclear what happened to him in the end."

They approached them at dinner time after being ejected from their army for their ineptitude. Regarding them with narrowed eyes at first, she welcomed them with a smile to show her children the power of forgiveness. Her travels ended when she founded a nation, and history remembered her as a symbol of affection."

                truearts: `While the multiplier would have been good if she came out 3 years ago, it has a hard time holding up nowadays. The healing off critical damage does offer some extra survivability to her, but sadly she doesn't offer anything to help the team survive.`,
                ability1: `While the Critical rate buff is appreciated, 50% is on the more inconsistent side.`,

                overall: `Melissa was a decent unit who released far too late and even being this late lacks a dragon she can really pair up with. Her self healing on TA is nice, but the fact she doesn't have 100% crit rate for her healing prevent it from helping on hellfire stages. Her damage is far too outclassed to be useful in todays meta with some perma pool units being able to out damage her and out perform her with paralyzing.`,

However, they were suddenly attacked during one training session by an infamous band of thieves who wanted to steal her unique weapon.

Returning home to promise her family she would win a major martial arts tournament and its purse, she set out on a new journey."

His Cross Arts with Cestina offers some use, but due to the many conditions for its activation it will rarely be seen. Despite these limitations, he can definitely hold his own and has use in certain areas of content.`,

Still, the sheer amount of possibilities enabled by this relatively unique buff on its own bolster Liza enough to be touted as an excellent support unit, especially alongside the addition of powerful offensive debuffs.`,
                crossarts: `The DMG up buff and large modifier, while extremely powerful, is not only limited but also out of place considering it requires two subpar attackers in order to even activate. You're more often than not better off just using Liza's Arts and True Arts.`,

            {
                skill: `An ability that is not very useful when it comes to bosses, but it can help speed up the mob rounds of a quest if it has one.`,
                arts: `A decent PHY RES debuff that can help with physical attackers in dealing more damage. This not only helps Orvell, but also the team's DPS for time when the extra damage is needed such as speeding up a quest or for nuking. Aside from that, Orvell's Arts should be used to start stacking the Testament to the King passive. Paired with an accuracy buff to himself, this helps with dealing with tricky enemies with evasion. The increased accuracy buff by itself is not enough as a standalone to compensate the evasion enemies has however, so it can't be relied on heavily. But because there aren't too many enemies that has evasion, the buff itself is pretty niche.`,
                truearts: `A high multiplier with a self stat boost to compliment it for more damage. With the stat boost, it can serve as a pseudo heal for Orvell, making him a bit more self-sustainable. At 5 stacks of Testament to the King, the damage is greatly increased  due to the ability to ignore enemies' DEF. Because of this, he is suitable for nuke compositions and can serve as a general DPS.`,
                crossarts: `Its high multiplier may seem appealing to deal more damage and a 50 art refund to both Orvell and Virago, but the prerequisite is also high from both units. Only at 5 stacks of both Testament to the King and Overlord’s Squire does the multiplier increase and by that time, the enemy would already be dead. The lack of synergy between Orvell and Virago also makes it difficult to fit them both into a team, making it very restricting on what units you can actually use.`,
                ability1: `This is the bread and butter of Orvell; with each Arts and True Arts, a damage buff is applied and Orvell's Skill CT REC is boosted as well. Because Orvell lacks innate crit, he's missing out on the extra damage that comes with crit. This ability helps him overcome that with a 200% DMG increase and the ignore DEF on his True Arts, which is very useful for all content and especially in stages that negates crit. With Orvell having high multipliers, the DMG increase helps him to a greater degree.`,
                ability2: `Being able to resist Freeze and Paralyze means that Orvell will not get interrupted during his Arts and True Arts, making him a more competent DPS`,
                ability3: `A minor buff that seldom sees any use because most often units' health does not drop to the threshold, even more so with Orvell having a pseudo heal on his True Arts.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `A niche buff that only applies to Light units. In terms of buffing Orvell himself, this increases his damage a considerable amount. But with its long CT, it makes it less useful for DPS and general content.`,
                    ability1: `A high buffing ability that helps improve Orvell's damage further. The attack up buff is magnified with Orvell's high damage multipliers and DMG Up buffs, making his damage much higher. There are other equips that you can use in turn however, so his True Weapon is not a must.`,
                    ability2: `A slight increase in BE generation may help, but overall it's nothing significant.`
                },
                overall: `Orvell is a great unit to use as an attacker, and with enough support, his damage can become very potent. His kit fits in both drawn-out battles and in nuke-oriented compositions. Orvell's offensive slot only further his outstanding capabilities, though as a result, he struggles to generate his own Arts. With the right team, Orvell can truly become a competent self-sustaining attacker.`,

However, he is still at the end of the day just another DPS who has little to no versatility outside of his damage and crit-buffing. Furthermore, he depends on Chloe in order to truly achieve the high numbers you may see on TA, reducing your unit comps immensely to be built around him. All in all, a very good one-trick pony that makes his presence known amongst other contenders.`,

The Arts refund is massive, and the combination of Chloe's 3 APS passive (when Luahn is in the party) with Luahn's 3 APS generation on Cross Arts allows you to essentially spam their Cross Arts as long as Chloe remains alive. The other buffs to Luahn allow him to bring a multitude of buffs, debuffs, and damage to the team.

When Chloe wears a Raaz Crown, and steps into the arena, her revive passive also allows her to become a cheesey arena unit. Overall, a very powerful luck unit and normal unit.`,

                skill: `Should net you one Dragon Flame stack from the get-go for most stages, though a bit slow on its own if you actually plan to build her up. Burn can also play into Angelas' passive, but it's a far from reliable source of critical hit chance.`,
                arts: `Quick dragon flame stacks, though it's incredibly awkward given the fact that you'll require additional arts support specifically to sustain Angelas given the necessity of these stacks for her nuke. The burn resistance reduction is hardly ever useful despite its chained synergy with Angelas' Skill, Crit Passive, and True Weapon passive - it's just much too demanding and inconsistent of a source of crit chance.`,
                truearts: `Angelas' True Arts is completely at the mercy of how many Dragon Flame stacks you've acquired: it's a more than solid multiplier to go off of for nuking when her passive is sufficiently stacked, especially given her Dragon Flame buffs; but it's an utter waste of time without them. Her arts refund should allow you to recycle stacks more effectively in the case you're using her as a DPS unit rather than a nuker, though this isn't the best approach for reasons that'll be discussed later.`,
                ability1: `While this does go hand and hand with Angelas' own Arts and Skill, it can be a bit too inconsistent for nuking given you likely won't have time to apply burn resistance down with her arts before you burst the boss down. Still always a nice thing to have despite the fact that it doesn't work well with her intended purpose.`,
                ability2: `A significant enough damage buff, though breaking as a mechanic is seen in increasingly few pieces of content recently, causing this passive to come into play once in a blue moon at best.`,
                ability3: `This passive provides the main gimmick that Angelas' entire kit revolves around, providing quite a meaningful offensive debuff for her and her team as well as dealing significant damage, though this generally gets overshadowed by her True Arts damage.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `The key to this True Weapon is that due to its conditional nature, it stacks with other sources of Physical DMG Resistance down such as 'Snippity-Snips' or 'Type 30 Bayonet' to name a few, making this an amazing resource for bolstering the damage of not only teams Angelas takes part in, but physical nukes as a whole.`,
                    ability1: `Quite a large damage boost to encourage the use of her burn mechanic, though you're oftentimes better off using an external source of critical hit rate. As for the passive boost, it really shouldn't be too significant if you're aptly supporting Angelas in the first place.`,
                    ability2: `A pretty straight-forward passive that increases the User's offensive capabilities. While small, it's certainly good to have on any attacker unit.`
                },
                overall: `Coming off as a solid attacker and more specifically a nuker, though not a groundbreaking one for the most part, Angelas is the owner of one of the highest multipliers in the game. And to take full advantage of it, she requires a great amount damage-optimizing buffs such as DMG Up and DMG Resistance down from other sources, making her optimal role in nuking given how short-lived these buffs generally are. That is, however, not to say that her DPS capabilities are underwhelming, just that her lack of self-sufficiency and higher maintenance than most DPS units hinder her in that aspect. Overall, a competent unit who suffers due to difficult Dragon Flame stacking and generally lags behind her team as a result.`,

                    skill: `Incredibly mediocre as a Defence equip. The only redeeming factor of this equip is its decent defence buff (which is essentially negated by Critical Damage) and its great recovery time. Still, not remotely worth getting or using.`,
                    ability1: `Because Eagle is a DPS, right. The Arts DMG boost is appreciated, but again very out of place for a unit that should be trying to defend and stay alive more than do damage. The Fill Rate however, does allow Eagle to reach his max potential as a Taunt faster, so that is a very good ability that works with his kit.`,

                overall: `The devs came up with an attempt at a DPS Taunt tank that was interesting in theory, but mediocre in practice, due to not having any potent in-built Damage Resistance tied to his kit. Add to the fact that his TA is literally 10% Damage Resistance with a 60k% multiplier in Avenger Mode, and you get a mismatched taunt tank that wanted to hit hard, but threw away almost all the aspects of what makes a defensive unit defensive, apart from the slots.`,

                truearts: `Those are some pretty nice buffs there for light units. Unfortunately, if you aren't a light unit, what you get is a decent, though still genuinely useful pseudo-heal and an extremely niche buff to accuracy. However, if you're running this on a mono-light team, Victoire becomes one of the most consistent and potent healers in the game on top of noticeable buffs. Still, quite a niche scenario you'd have to be in to find yourself resorting to such a composition`,
                ability1: `Quite a noticeable debuff when it's applied to a large enough enemy, and when combined with her arts buff, she can almost loop. While this is an all-around decent tool in her box for survivability, its usefulness can be inconsistent at best due to the diversity in the game's stages.`,
                ability2: `Victoire isn't primarily an attacker, and even then, this buff is so niche that it just won't matter in the majority of situations despite its high figure.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `A surprisingly potent debuff for... light nuke teams? Quite unfitting for a light support unit to say the least. While this role and effect mismatch doesn't entirely justify it on Victoire, it's certainly looking like a staple for a different kind of composition.`,
                    ability1: `That's more like it! This is the potent arts generation option if you plan on using Victoire, and should definitely be seen as a must-have equipment to get the full potential out of her. The duration increase is nice, but her buffs weren't the most critical to be able to cycle to begin with.`,
                    ability2: `Not a particularly bad passive, but it'll be inconcequential most of the time due to its lower potency.`
                },
                overall: `Victoire ticks all the boxes for being a niche support who still has a place on certain teams. Conditionally potent buffs? Check. Highly-situational utility? Check. Gimmicky mechanics that really shine on select stages? Another check. That being said, what she brings to the table, especially for mono light teams can't be understated, becoming one of the most potent healers and stats buffers in the game. Outside of the few scenarios she can be fully-utilized, her slot is best reserved for a more general-purpose unit. And thus, although helming some extremely flashy support, you'll be unlikely to see her as the leader of most bands.`,

She was able to do so because of the golden hairs from a fox spirit what were mixed into the head of the brush.

No, the Fox Deity that had jumped out of the illustration stood before her. This led her to deciding to embark on a journey the next morning, saying farewell to the shrine that had been so good to her. It was through this journey that countless picture scrolls were produced, and would eventually be passed down throughout the generations. One of these scrolls was the 'Legend of the Sealed Fox.'"

However, her awakening gave her a mysterious healing power, so she traveled the battlefields, treating the wounded. Her acts of compassion paved the road to the birth and rule of a new nation.",
                evoawk: "Juno was the first queen of Granadia, often referred to as the mother of the burgeoning nation. With miraculous powers, she cleansed the land defiled by monsters and founded a new nation. Though mistakenly described as fierce and ambitious in the chronicles, personal accounts from the time paint her as a warm and thoughtful figure. The very prescence of the Templars, devotees who supporter her in every aspect of life, was proof of that."

Despite the short duration, Hart's True Arts more than makes up for it in sheer potency, offering perhaps the highest heal over time buff in the game on top of arts generation near the best-in-class, especially when combined with the additional generation for humans.

                overall: `Hey, it’s the first Phantom Sniper to actually use Phantom Bullet and actually has a gun, albeit not a sniper! No doubt, Simon is definitely an amazing unit. Not only does he perform well in sustain situations, able to consistently ramp and deal damage, but also excels in Dark nukes. Being Dark and Human, he is able to take full advantage of Forte’s, a key support unit in Dark nukes, buffs. Coupled with the huge Damage multiplier on his Phantom Bullet and nuke-friendly slots, he can easily fill the shoes of a DPS nuker. With the right support from equips and other units, he is able to rival the current Saitama nukes dominating most leaderboards in terms of Damage. Best of all, he has a pretty sick gun :)`,

                arts: `While the attack buff is decent, it won't get much use because it has a low uptime and Vultee isn't a DPS. The 50% arts refund would allow you to spam Arts more, however there's still no reason to use it over his True Arts and Phantom Bullet, as it will lower your available Phantom Bullet count.`,
                truearts: `While a general damage buff would be preferred over an element locked one, this still helps Vultee synergize with other great earth units like Fitoria or Cestina. The sturdy barrier also ties him with some of the top tanks for the highest total negation per TA/PB, allowing him to soak up more damage than other tanks like Gerald or Naofumi.`,
                phantombullet: `A chonky shield paired with the other sources of DMG resistance on his kit means Vultee can soak up a lot of damage from bosses, and even more from physical bosses. While he can only be used at max potential for 6 Phantom Bullets, ideally most missions won't last through all of them, and he is still very tanky regardless.`,
                ability1: `While it is a decent buff in terms of percentage, the ATK buff doesn't do much for him when he isn't ramped, which as mentioned before, there's no reason to do. The DMG resistance however provides an added layer of security in the event his health starts getting low, and if he has proper gear and PB activated it can help him hit 100% passive Physical DMG resistance.`,
                ability2: `Nothing too special, and completely useless if the boss can crit.`,
                ability3: `More passive DMG resistance. when paired with the rest of his kit, he can hit 60% Physical DMG resistance without the help of other units or equips.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `While it isn't amazing, 25% uptime is still pretty decent, especially paired with a sizable Physical resistance debuff when on an earth unit.`,

                },
                overall: `Having the ability to reach high and even 100% Physical DMG resistance with the right gear makes Vultee-Lr one of the best if not the best taunt tanks for physical damage, and even with other types he preforms exceptionally well alongside the other top tanks like Miranda or Thetis. While it would ideally be a general buff, his stacking teamwide Earth Damage buff works well when he is in a team with damage dealing Earth units like Fitoria, Deadmaster, or Rudeus. And although it would be nice if he had two defense slots, the physical slot allows him to hold artsgen equipment to make him more self sufficient, and the heal slot allows him to hold a blessed necklace for a self revive on missions that have a big nuke. Even as a general tank without PB, he still does his job well, and will be a great addition to your box regardless of whether you're a vet or a newbie.`,

Ramping the ATK buffs requires an unnecessary amount of time and art gauge for most quests, and ramping or alternating will just end up taking more time than you need to clear. For nuking, this wouldn't have any relevance due to another/better source of fire resistance debuffing already being present in a proper fire nuke, and just in general, the critical rate and damage buffs from True Arts would provide a lot more value.`,

                skill: `Pretty good arts generation, one of the best things anyone could ask for on a skill. Considering her critical rate passives, there usually won't be trouble utilizing this skill.`,
                arts: `While it is one of those stacking mechanics, at least the damage buffs are teamwide and optional as opposed to a major requirement for certain units to deal damage themselves (i.e Orvell/Batiste). Most usage for the Normal Arts will be in long-term quests with multi-elemental sustain teams, situations where you will more likely have the opportunity to ramp these buffs up. However, do note that you have to bring a critical rate buffer if you're actually planning to make use of this.`,
                truearts: `Having to compose the team of at least three unique elements, this will restrict options on who to bring as support/buffers. Some nuking examples are Shadie with Cestina + Kimono Milim or Erza + Forte, while Mako + Hart + [Non-Earth/Non-Light Damage Support] or Erza + Hart + [Water/Fire/Dark Arts Generator] will work nicely as sustaining compositions. As long as you can set up a decent multi-elemental team, Lyla should be able to delete most bosses if the true arts can actually land. Yes, do note that due to her animations, her true arts may not hit the boss.`,
                ability1: `The amount is fairly decent, but you probably won't come across beast enemies too often.`,
                ability2: `It's the small puzzle piece to complete the 100% critical rate when in conjunction with her main passive.`,
                ability3: `It's effectively 100% critical rate when taking her other critical rate passive into account. Status ailments aren't an issue for the majority of quests, so utilizing this passive usually won't be difficult.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `True Maximus applies a hefty physical damage resistance debuff on enemies when equipped on Lyla, and considering its generous cooldown for a resistance debuffing item, it's pretty good on her for sustaining. For nuking, it's the most potent option for inflicting physical resistance when it's equipped on her, but it's still substitutable with alternatives that offer 5% less (or with True Draco La'cryma) if you do not have it.`,
                    ability1: `This will boost her damage output by a fairly large amount.`,
                    ability2: `Because it only affects the damage dealt by Lyla's skill, this effect is negligible.`
                },
                overall: `Unlike most units, Lyla will not perform as well on mono-elemental teams, and her large multiplier's reliance on unique elements largely limits the possible compositions you can make with her. However, Lyla can deal a huge amount of DPS if you can place her in a compatible team. Unfortunately, her attacks' hitbox is pretty bad as it shoots toward the ground, so her position on the screen will be something important to keep note of as she may miss sometimes. Newer players (or those with less options and variety in their unit lists) will struggle to make the most out of her kit, and most players will generally opt for a less-restrictive DPS option to place on their teams. As for the nuking connoisseurs, they'll most likely have compositions that are stronger and easier to make (i.e Saitama/Simon nukes).`,

                skill: `A long skill CT with a decent buff duration to boost her damage. You will look to keep this buff active before either of her Arts in order to increase her damage output.`,
                arts: `Decent multiplier with pretty niche effects. The skill CT recovery buff can see use in Miasma stages and the Water RES debuff would be nice to further amplify her damage or support water nuking; However, for general use and nuking, you would just default to her True Arts instead.`,
                truearts: `A hefty multiplier paired with stackable damage buffs. Her damage is further amplified when she is allowed to stack as a result of the lengthy 50 second buff duration, especially against longer stages. The nature of its stacking ability also makes it stackable with magic and water damage buffs from other units such as Santa Rimuru, etc. Hence, this True Arts solidifies Summer Juno as a competent dps as well as damage support for the team for general use or nuking purposes.`,
                ability1: `Self sufficiency is always appreciated though it is tied to a HP condition. Healing might be required for certain situations if you want to keep this passive running.`,
                ability2: `Another source of self sufficiency in her kit but tied to her being free of status ailments this time. Bring cleanse if stage is known to inflict status ailments to keep this passive running.`,
                ability3: `A nice boost when dealing with giant bosses to further increase her damage output.`,

                    skill: `Another artsgen equipment for general usage. On top of it, it increases own stats by 30% if Water unit. Which works well with Summer Juno's passive.`,
                    ability1: `As if the duration wasn't long enough already. This will enable Summer Juno to stack at least one more True Art.`,
                    ability2: `It's a nice bonus, but nothing too noticeable.`
                },
                overall: `As if Summer Juno wasn't already strong enough. With her buffs she is now capable of dealing even more damage than before. Furthermore, she has amazing self sufficiency with her passives and damage buffs for the team especially for magic/water teams. That being said, she’s one of the best magic dps units, and a common unit in magic and/or water nuking comps. The damage buffs she provides aren't a joke either as the duration of the buffs with her True Weapon will allow her to keep up 5-6 stacks on average with enough support. She is ultimately a luxury gift for any box, so don't go overboard and save your money.`,

                skill: `A pretty decent skill. The 10 Arts is nice as well as the stackable Magic Res debuff that he applies to enemies. The downside is that the skill is extremely slow so chances are that only one debuff would be active at a time. Maybe two or three with enough Skill CT buffs.`,
                arts: `The buffs on this arts work pretty well with his skill since it would allow him to apply at least two Magic Res debuffs at a time. The 30% Equip CT is a very nice added bonus. Overall, it's a good arts but a bit selfish since none of the buffs are teamwide`,
                truearts: `Now this is where most of Vultee's damage will come from. A nice teamwide Ignore Def buff + Arts DMG buff based on the number of water allies, making him a good option for water nuking in general, or for that one stage in Water Ruins that needs Ignore Def.`,
                ability1: `A pretty strong buff! Keeping his health above 80% is a pretty easy thing to do since there's plenty of ways to go about it such as using a competent healer, a taunt tank, or just having enough damage mitigation.`,
                ability2: `An extremely niche passive that will probably be forgotten about since 90% of the content doesn't involve Hellfire anyway`,
                ability3: `Another pretty strange passive that probably won't affect anything most of the time.  It does allow him to start with additional Arts depending on the unit he replaces, but as mentioned previously, this will not see use outside of a select few quests (Cross Battles) and Raids.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `Pretty decent damage for a pretty decent CT.  The 30% Water Res reduction and 50% DMG increase are nice little additions that make this a decent equip for water nuking, although Melty Shoes would probably do the job better`,
                    ability1: `A nice passive arts gen that makes this one of the best options for one of Vultee’s magic equips`,
                    ability2: `Very negligible.  A 10% increase shouldn’t make too much of a difference`
                },
                overall: `At first glance, Vultee seems like a pretty good water dps.  While there are other units like Summer Juno, Joker Selia, Santa Rimuru, and Emilia (and some others that I’m forgetting), he could work in place of them if you lack any of them.  Overall, he’s a decent dps that allows the team to do some extra damage, especially since his buffs affect “all” teams in general and are not limited to monowater or magic based teams.`,

While being compared to his biggest counterpart, Juno, he's much faster, with decent equipment you can get his TA off in 9 seconds without needing to worry about BE. His TA's healthdrain is instant and a bit weaker, However, due to how spammable his TA is you'll still be draining health at a rather concerning rate. Good thing his Normal art can be cycled in as needed to provide some healing or just put a decent healer on the team.

                So, why is Emperor not actually the must Pity unit? Well, it comes down to the fact that we can still clear content without him. When the main appeal of these Type B Artsgens is their high APS amount with a strong secondary effect (Hart = Healing + Stats, Juno = DPS + Accuracy, Emperor = All supportive buffs except crit), you’ll find that Emperor only serves as an optimization of your Type B Artsgen Slot, providing more damage when paired with the Physical Teams and versatility through Sword Buffs, Pseudo-Healing, and all 5 Star Slotting.
                
                In other words: He’s the best but you still need units to build around him to clear endgame difficulty quests.`,

                ability2: `A bit of work needed to get into Magia Unlimited to access this passive but doubling her damage means she'll be doing quite a bit offensively. The increase damage to water enemies isn't reliable but when it is relevant she'll be even more effective at her damage dealing role.`,

                    skill: `A pretty hefty active on a moderate CT for Earth/Magic sustain strategies and even great for Earth/Magic nuking strategies, though the latter isn't widely used. Rosetta herself will enjoy this, though not necessarily just for the active.`,
                    ability1: `An unconditional passive 40% damage buff to Rosetta is pretty good and increasing her arts when she enters Magia Drive is decent. A pretty good True Weapon on Rosetta with all things considered.`,
                    ability2: `And of course to top it all off: the obligatory useless generic passive.`
                },
                overall: `Foliage Carver Rosetta looks amazing on paper - great buffs and debuffs while doing a ton of damage but she suffers from a few issues. She needs a lot of outside support to ramp her up to her full damage potential. Not to mention, getting to Magia Unlimited will take a bit of time due to animations and needing lots of arts.

                The other problem is that magic support units aren't as coveted as other types of supports as Grand Summoner's meta still favors physical damage. Even when magic comps are good, you'd likely prefer other units in her stead.
                
                That isn't to say she's bad! She's one of the few units who can give a sizeable Equip CT buff, so if you're missing Liza, Rosetta might allow you to clear content that you hadn't before. Even without doing her complicated Magia Unlimited, she is still a very competent support unit with just True Arts spam.`,

                skill: `A basic skill that can sometimes slightly increase the team’s damage output. Note though that the DMG RES debuff does not stack with any other such general debuffs.`,
                arts: `Fits in the context of Fire Orvell’s kit that revolves around spamming an equip. However, this has marginal utility because how more beneficial spamming his True Arts is in comparison.`,
                truearts: `There we are, the bread and butter of Fire Orvell’s kit. High multiplier, teamwide magic damage buff and self ATK buff, and unlocks Super Equip “Gramlude” that can be spammed for even more damage buffs. This basically enables Fire Orvell to reach overall damage buffs that easily exceed 400% (provided he can deal critical damage), thereby making him one of the top DPSes in the game. Besides raw damage, spamming a damage-dealing equip at high velocity also generates a substantial amount of battle ether (which helps with team arts) and deals a non-negligible amount of break.`,
                superequip: `30% stackable critical DMG buff that can be stacked every 2s. With a 15s duration, up to 7 buffs (240% total) can be stacked and cycled, and EQ CT buffs can further increase this number by reducing the equip cooldown. The passives of the 5-star magic equip are retained during this time, meaning that it is possible to use an equip with passives that will strategically provide added utility (such as damage buffs, EQCT buffs, etc.). As stated before, spamming this equip also generates lots of battle ether, and the break resulting can also add up rather quickly.`,
                ability1: `Can help slightly mitigate the damage Fire Orvell receives, especially against bosses that have increased critical rate against a target unit (whom is often the unit who deals the most damage).`,
                ability2: `Marginal passive that can nonetheless help finish off bosses faster.`,
                ability3: `Conditional artgen passive to help make him more self-sustainable, and a conditional critical rate that is central to his damage output, as his Super Equip gives him critical DMG buffs.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `A magic DMG buff and fire RES debuff that can be used right before TA to increase damage output. However, it must be noted that the duration of these buffs is 15s, which means that when Fire Orvell reaches max Super Equip stacks, these buffs will likely have timed out.`,
                    ability1: `Damage and stats buffs that remain when the Ultra Equip is active. However, these are marginal given the high damage buffs that Fire Orvell can typically achieve.`,
                    ability2: `A small physical RES buff that can help Fire Orvell stay above 80% hp.`
                },
                overall: `Fire Orvell has obscene DPS potential as long as the boss does not have high critical resistance, stacking critical DMG buffs. Beyond this though, his Ultra Equip also helps with team artgen through battle ether generation, and also benefits from relatively good break which can be useful in some quests. His 5* defense slot helps with team survivability in difficult content. Obviously, DPS units always tend to get superseded at some point, but right now, Fire Orvell is among the top DPS in the game, and his added utility helps him edge out his competitors.`,

                For those that missed out on Draken, here's another shot at a good damage support unit! She packs quite a punch and provides buffs without needing to be at full HP. Even if you have Draken, she'll slot into mono-Fire nuking strategies well. Though she has some random parts to her overall kit, that doesn't detract from her role as a toptier damage support unit or a healer.`,

However, once you get past that startup she is a solid artgen option for those who lack the aforementioned top tier units or when running content which doesn't let you use them like dark ruins. While her artgen my not be able to compete with the faster startup of other untis, her large and stackable dmg res down would have some utility even when paired with someone else like Juno.`,

                skill: `Artgen on skill, tremendously useful for self-sustainability. 50 unconditional arts is huge, and helps War Hero Fen cycle his various arts easily when paired with a Primary Artsgen unit such as Hart, Emperor, or Juno.`,
                arts: `It cannot be stated how useful EQCT buffs are, enabling full uptime on certain defense equips and helping artgen equips reset faster. Furthermore, it is also accompanied by a 40% accuracy buff, which is somewhat useful as several bosses have evasion.`,
                truearts: `Teamwide crit along with unconditional artgen that stacks with most other units, something that is fairly rare so far, allowing players to slot in DPS units that previously lacked Crit Rate. And a decent TA multiplier as well. 20% super critical rate is a nice added touch, it cannot be too relied upon because of its aleatory nature but it helps buff War Hero Fen’s TA damage output.`,
                superarts: `Ridiculously high DPS coupled with a 40% supercritical rate and a long-lasting ATK buff. Outdamages virtually anything else in the game unless the boss has critical resistance, in which case it still deals appreciable damage simply due to how high the multiplier is.`,
                ability1: `30% free DMG RES that is available from the start of the quest with no other effort needed that having War Hero Fen as leader. Most quests will not last the 45s duration with him on board, and for those that do, it gives ample time to set up proper defenses. Note that if cresting other units with him on the team, he will not be able to be leader.`,
                ability2: `Helps kickstart team arts, whether in a sustain or nuke scenario. Note that this passive does not stack with Dark Fen’s, but does stack with Forte/Draken/NY Milim’s.`,
                ability3: `Helps everyone finish off enemies faster, especially at low hp when they tend to be most dangerous.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `Decent instant artgen with a good arts/s rate coupled with a DMG buff for humans. It is a nice option as a permanently available teamwide artgen equip, but ultimately it is replaceable by any other teamwide artgen equip.`,
                    ability1: `Mild damage buff passive, along with a skill CT buff which will help a bit with artgen from skill.`,
                    ability2: `A small DMG buff against Human enemies.`
                },
                overall: `Arguably the best unit in the game alongside Emperor Isliid, War Hero Fen does virtually everything except healing. While his arts/s output is not as high as some other units, he has a rare artsgen type (type A) that enables him to stack arts with most units, and he will outright have every unit start with 50 arts. He offers accuracy, EQCT and crit buffs, some teamwide DMG RES when leader, and he can also deal ridiculously high damage on top. War Hero Fen is thus an extremely versatile and self-sufficient unit who can fit well on virtually any team. Being able to use three different arts also makes him a much less linear unit than some of the older awakened units who too often spam the same arts over and over again. War Hero Fen breaks this trend, and proper arts cycling will prove invaluable to extract his full potential. Note that while the defense slot is a nice addition, the scarcity of Expert Limit Break Stones makes it so that other future units may be preferable to limit break beyond the standard LB5.`,

With Cosmo's only real competition for best paralyze option being Norn and Elfalla, she blows them both out the water in both consistency and damage. Although her lack of self sufficiency does hurt a bit, the 3 aps she gets from her TW helps. However, what helps her the most is the surplus of amazing light units to pair up with to make the most of her passive dmg up per paralyze.`,

Letting him enter True Third Eye ain't a difficult task as well, because most meta relevant units are from the Human Race.

However, his Arts effects do not activate immediately after use due to its animation cast time, which can be a detriment at times. Teamwide Skill refresh, while not reliably useful, has certain potential when paired with specific content or units such as those with ArtsGen on Skill.`,
            truearts: `Finally being buffed to the usual 4 arts/s of collab ArtsGen units, his overall ArtsGen has been boosted slightly. His 30% All Stats buff, which can act as a pseudo-heal allows for better team survivability, but should not be relied on as the only heals for harder content. With those 2 buffs in mind, Rimuru remains in the realm of a more than competent general-use support and ArtsGen unit. Lastly, his self lifesteal effect matters very little outside of very specific stages and is generally negligible.`,
            ability1: `A decent passive but does very little for most stages that don’t have Fire bosses`,
            ability2: `A great passive that helps Rimuru’s consistency. The Status RES passive is useful in certain situations but with cleanse built into his kit, it’s not as important `,

Moreover, all of this is backed up by passive ArtsGen on self and great slots. There’s really not much to hate about Rimuru’s kit as a support unit. Though in certain aspects he has been powercrept due to his age, very few units come close to Rimuru’s sheer utility and flexibility as a support unit and would be a welcome addition to most boxes. His buffs simply helped to improve his overall kit closer to the addition of the units.`,

            arts: `Gives his allies more self sufficiency from their Artsgennerating Skills and a little damage boost, but generally not worth using over his True Arts unless bursting enemy down from a sliver of hp. At least the duration of the buffs are considerably good.`,
            truearts: `Providing the current largest amount of MAG RES on either version of the game, Benimaru is a strong choice for Magic Nukes whenever he is capable of Burning.`,
            ability1: `As always, self sufficiency is good, but you shouldn't be near death 99% of the time anyways.`,
            ability2: `An inconsistent amount of Crit Rate however it allows Benimaru to go above 100% Crit Rate whenever required.`,

Freeze and Paralysis, especially if the ailment lasts very long, can be such a bother, but with this skill on loop and Naofumi taunting for the team, Freeze/Paralysis won't be an issue for the most part.`,
                arts: `The central part of his entire kit, redirecting damage taken towards himself while providing him a chonky barrier to help soak up the damage. Additionally, he provides some extra offensive support with a small damage buff for the entire team. With the buff he received to his Arts’ barrier amount, he is able to generate a bigger barrier compared to other taunt tanks such as Gerald and Celia.`,
                truearts: `Most quests don't require Faint or DEF ignore, and Naofumi simply isn't a good source of damage to begin with, even after the buffed DMG multiplier he received. Unless inflicting Faint has a notable counter to a certain boss's mechanics, like Ragsherum Phantom (Giant Boss) for example, Naofumi’s Arts would generally be used more often than his True Arts.`,
                ability1: `A small, additional DEF boost to help make Naofumi a bit tankier.`,
                ability2: `A nice barrier to help with your team's survivability for when the enemy deals a hefty amount of damage right off the bat, giving Naofumi some leeway before he is able to start taunting.`,

                        skill: `True "Small Shield" provides great defensive effects, but it has a pretty short duration while having a fairly long cooldown. If uptime isn't issue, feel free to run it. If it is, then you may want to opt for a higher uptime DEF equip instead.`,
                        ability1: `Increases his HP by a fairly reasonable amount, but it usually wouldn't matter much when under a barrier. Some art gauge generation, while small, is also always nice.`,
                        ability2: `It doesn't really have an impact whatsoever. You could treat this as if it's not even there. That's how insignificant the healing value is.`
                    },
                    true2: {
                        skill: `It provides some impressive single-target healing and seal cleansing, which may come in handy for Naofumi as sealing can obstruct him from reapplying his damage redirection or Freeze/Paralysis resistance.`,
                        ability1: `This would be the main reason for equipping this item on Naofumi. It substantially increases his barrier amount from 11000 to a whopping 15000, and the hefty 35% physical resistance gives him an edge over other tanks when it comes to handling Physical-based bosses.`,
                        ability2: `Small but still appreciable DEF boost towards his tanking capabilities.`
                    }
                },
                overall: `In short, Naofumi Iwatani offers tanking capabilities that are slightly better than other taunt tanks such as Gerald and Celia, but he can surpass them even more when he is equipped with his true weapons in the right situations. His true equipment (most notably True “Shield of Rage”) provides significant boosts to his ability to tank Physical bosses,, but he can still perform just fine even without it. What's also impressive is the fact that he is a FREE unit, giving newer players and unfortunate souls the opportunity to have a taunt tank and a luck unit. He's an easy and useful pick-up for newer players to help tackle hard-hitting quests, whilst still being very much a usable tank for those with more developed accounts. In terms of being a luck unit, Naofumi does not bring much to the table other than his high luck stat and being able to tank when farming something more difficult, but luck farms usually don't necessitate a tank.`,

This is especially so when paired with her True Arts’ Skill CT recovery buff and overall innate Crit Rate buffs.`,
                arts: `With the large refund of arts, this will likely serve as Raphtalia’s primary source of damage output after a True Arts use due to how immensely spammable it is. Furthermore, it has notable synergies with taunt tanks, though the heal generally won’t make too much of a difference as they’re spamming barriers anyways. As a side note, the 70 Arts refund does not have a limit, but rather is limited to one activation every Arts.`,
                truearts: `A large multiplier paired with buffs that synergize well with the rest of her kit. The general strategy would be to take advantage of the 35s buffs from her True Arts to spam her Arts continuously. Coupled with the ArtGen from her Skill, she will be self-sufficient for those 35s spamming Arts.`,
                ability1: `Nothing too spectacular on its own, though it does make her Arts refund more reliable as well as bolster her self-sufficiency from her Skill.`,
                ability2: `Accuracy is a fairly niche skill that won’t have an impact on most stages. The DMG up, although conditional, is relatively powerful on its own, boosting Raphtalia’s overall DMG at the cost of having to run a Taunt tank.`,
                trueweapon: {
                    skill: `This is a great equip, not only on Raphtalia, but also on units whose Skill acts as a major part of their kit (in Raphtalia’s case, it’ll optimally generate 0.68 arts/sec). Although it won’t be explicitly better than an Arts generation equip on most units, it still holds value outside of being bound to Raphtalia.`,
                    ability1: `With this True Weapon, this means that Raphtalia can effectively reach 100% Critical Rate when combined with her True Arts and passive, allowing for much more consistent spamming of her arts. The DMG is generally just an added bonus and cements this item as one of the best for Raphtalia.`,
                    ability2: `A passive that has a specific audience. On most units, this won’t mean much, but like the equipment’s active effect, this can do extremely well on units where their Skill is an essential part of their kit.`
                },
                overall: `While Raphtalia was never a beacon of DPS units, she was certainly able to get the job done with her very arts spam-oriented kit. Despite her seemingly-fun kit, however, she offers very little outside of the damage she provides, making her a relatively weak asset to teams given her only strength is shared by a large pool of DPS units. On luck teams, she still fares well enough due to her gacha status and self-sufficiency, but finds difficulty competing with much faster options. Overall, she's a decent beginner DPS option who will likely get phased out rather quickly once players get access to better alternatives.`,

                arts: `A rather sizeable bit of DMG res and negligible barrier. Having 50% DMG RES against water enemies makes this a great option against any water boss who hits hard.`,

Her Artgen and healing being on her Skill means it's up at the start of the fight and can support the team from the beginning. Her Art provides solid dmg res, even more so against water bosses. While her True Art increases all allies DMG while also doing some nice DMG itself.`,

                truearts: `With a decent multiplier, and a very high chance to inflict Ultimate Freeze, and a heavy Water resistance down when inflicting ultimate freeze. Emilia is a very potent damage supporting unit unless the boss has high freeze resistance as Ultimate Freeze provides 100% Crit RES down to the enemy as well as 80% water resistance down debuff, if inflicted by ultimate freeze from her True Arts. This pairs well especially for mono water (nuke) teams.`,
                ability1: `Nothing too bad, but nothing too great. A nice passive that’ll help Emilia to be kept safe with the HP. Although, it’s not really noticeable when running a taunt, or another source of healing in the team.`,
                ability2: `A huge damage buff, which provides Emilia and her team with more dps which pairs well with her True Art, if inflicting Ultimate Freeze.`,

With the side effect of using her NA to reduce the Enemy’s Freeze Resistance by 30% which pairs well with her True Arts to inflict Ultimate Freeze, if you are able to use her True Art in the duration of 15s after Debuff is applied.`,
                    ability2: `It's a nice bonus, but nothing too noticeable.`,

With the buffs Emilia received, her role as support unit was improved and makes Water Nuking more consistent on bosses that are freezable.`,

Despite this, with the buffs, she can do a lot of damage with her numerous stacking CRI DMG and Arts gauge buffs as long as adequate support (Heals, shields, etc.) is provided.`,

Because it is conditional to the enemy being a giant boss (which includes over 70% of bosses, including all raids and mines bosses), it stacks with other dmg res buffs.`,

He is also one of a few Fire elemental ArtsGen unit, and would excel in mono-fire elemental teams alongside his attack buff on True Arts. His Arts when ramped is also amazing as a permanent offensive support for physical damage oriented teams. Overall, Yoh is a solid unit and a great addition to any box.`,

                arts: `At first it may sound nice, providing burst Arts gauge and a soft survival tool in the form of Enemy DMG Reduction, a rarer form of DMG RES UP (and stacks multiplicatively with). However her slow slotting hinders her from performing as a sub artsgen. You’re better sticking to her TA most of the time and should only use NA in case your units are <20 Arts away from a TA. As for the DMG reduction, most of the time it’s better to just bring a form of hard survival (barrier and/or heal) with additional Defense equips if still not enough, since on bosses that apply large DMG Up buffs on self, this effect won’t have much impact.`,
                truearts: `An average multiplier coupled with DEF Ignore and a hefty teamwide 60% Earth DMG buff. This is where the bulk of her kit lies, providing a great offensive tool in a mono-Earth comp, both in sustain and nuking. Add her third passive into play and you get a whopping 100% Earth DMG UP. The generously long duration of the buffs can also help leverage Allies’ damage in sustain comps, aside from niche usage on certain stages.`,

With a 20 Arts gauge refund on Arts, one might assume she can perform as a sub artsgen. However, her bad slotting heavily hinders her in this regard. As for her Enemy DMG Reduction debuff, it’s merely a scratch on the sheer amount of DMG UP buffs a boss can apply. This makes her NA better thought as an additional tool when you have enough artsgen to rotate her NA and TA. Packing heavy Earth-based DMG buffs and a lack of notable utilities, Anna has a hard time finding a use outside mono Earth situations.`,

Moreover, he is able to passively gain Arts from simply being above 70% HP, which isn’t very difficult to maintain, allowing him to perform well in sustained fights.`,

It is only for magic damage, encouraging the use of magic-oriented units, though in the worst case scenario, she will give herself a permanent buff at the very least. Using Lucy in conjunction with other sources of artgen can allow her to use her NA 5 times to increase the whole team’s magic damage output by 150%, which is quite substantial.

The conditions on her passive seem kind of strict, but it ultimately isn't an issue for lengthier content (where it will matter most for her kit) since you're always expected to bring a healer for those kinds of stages anyway. And unlike most ramping DPS units, she doesn't need too much to get the ball rolling, and there aren't really any disadvantages that would deter her usage in general content as she would already be able to deal more than satisfactory damage from the get-go without hassles like stacking Normal Arts or severe health drain.
                For nuking, she can provide pretty good damage support, boasting a potent Light Resistance debuff and two 5-star physical slots that could fit more debuffs or buffs to further enhance the team's damage output while also dishing out a fairly large amount of damage herself. As a side note, her innate critical rate and ability to hold fast, hard-hitting weapons like True Grand Destin may be of use for clearing some mob stages on auto (or just in general).`,

                skill: `Impressive ArtGen on skill is always a treat and can be extremely helpful for quests with many waves. The faint chance is also generally negligible but nice for those pesky waves leading up to the boss.`,
                arts: `That is a rather large DMG buff for an Arts, despite being restricted to Human allies. Not a bad Arts to have, especially on a team consisting of Humans, although Mikey’s True Arts is the real show-stealer.`,
                truearts: `A hefty DMG multiplier, alongside a teamwide CRI rate buff. You will generally be defaulting to using his True Arts for most quests due to the immense DMG it is able to output alongside his unique passive and CRI rate buff for the entire team. As a side note for nukers, his True Arts animation is also fast, taking a little over a second for its first hit to land.`,
                ability1: `What an insane passive to have. This essentially gives Mikey a whopping 200% CRI DMG buff when he is at full HP, which is not hard to maintain with a capable healer on the team. This single-handedly makes Mikey an amazing Nuker, while also being a more than competent DPS.`,
                ability2: `A noticeable DMG buff against Humans, although most end-game bosses are Giant Bosses, so this isn’t as impressive in practice.`,
                ability3: `Nothing to complain about free passive ArtsGen. Definitely nice to have, especially when using Mikey in longer fights.`,

                },
                overall: `Chills. Mikey was definitely built for Dark nukes. Not only is he Dark and Human, which allows him to utilize the full buffs provided by Forte (Dark Nuke Support unit), but his unique passive grants him a whole 200% CRI DMG buff, alongside his high 70000% DMG Multiplier from his True Arts... As the cherry on top, he is also one of the few units with three 5☆ slots. With that said, he can even perform as a competent DPS for sustains, granting a teamwide CRI buff while outputting serious damage. He is definitely one of the prizes of the Part 1 banner, upgrading your nukes and filling up the missing DPS hole in your team.`,

Draken is able to leverage his Physical DMG buffs and debuffs to heavily buff any Physical nukes with hard-hitting units - ahem Mikey ahem. Additionally, he is also one of a few units in the game with 3 5☆ slots, made even rarer when you consider his 3 5☆ slots are PHY/PHY/MAG. To top it off, he is the only unit in the game with such an absurd 100% teamwide PHY DMG passive. For veterans capable of nuking, Draken is an amazing unit to pair alongside your hard-hitting PHY units, and is definitely worth at least a pull.`,

                truearts: `A very big multiplier that also enables Crits for the team if no Crit RES is in effect, which you’ll be spamming most of the time. It additionally provides between 56 and 224 Arts total in a short amount of time, but she has the Lucy problem of being dependent on how many water units are in your team. Thus making her more practical in ruins than in general content, since you’d want at least 3 water units on your team to make it worth your time or ideally use her in Mono-water. You shouldn't count on her as your main source of Artsgen with her slots anyway. She can function/work as a general DPS or in Mono-water nuke comps thanks to that, but here’s where it gets weird. Most of those nuke comps are also specifically built around magic DMG with JSelia having the same debuff while providing a hefty Water RES debuff on top of it, basically removing her from the competition.`,
                ability1: `A great boost to her Self-sufficiency in terms of passive ArtGen with conditions that should be relatively easy to fulfill.`,

                overall: `Empress is a heavy hitter with a mish-mash of different kits stitched together for more practicality, which ultimately ends up either not being very impactful, outclassed, or immensely team dependent. An example for that is her Artsgen, requiring a Mono-water team to even compete with other units like Melty or Sakura Miku. Her slots won't provide a lot in that direction as well, leaning more on the Sub or DPS style slots with only one 4* Support, though being good otherwise. She'll be able to provide a lot of Self-sufficiency for most roles with her passives though, if they are able to be kept active. She might see some usage in nukes and ruins, but she won’t change the current Mono-water comps by herself with her DMG type being incompatible with most. She's likely to end up as a DPS with some utility and to be replaced by some other unit sooner rather than later or not even seeing use at all with the last Crossover being Mikey and Draken outclassing her in terms of both DMG and providing buffs to boost the overall DMG. Nevertheless she’ll be a nice unit for people who are starting out or those not having a good DPS. For Veterans, she'll more than likely collect some dust or won't be as useful as her kit isn't outstanding.`,

However, she's very finnicky due to a mixture of her Demon Race restrictions and odd TA restrictions. Her TA buffs are great for selfish damage dealers or heavy hitting nukers, and if you are using a group of heavy hitting magic units, her Magic resistance down buffs will be of immense benefit to your damage output. But despite being pretty good, she pales slightly in comparison to other units due to her passives and skill falling short in general utility, and her lack of self sustainability. A decent unit to pick up, But certainly not worth a pity what with more valuble units expected in the future.`,

Noting how plenty of stages have at least 1-2 waves that can be inflicted with burn you’ll be able to gain these DMG stacks quite often.
                TLDR: Apply Burn for DMG Up, once stacked alternate True Arts & Super Arts for plenty of damage output.

                skill: `ArtsGen on skill with a relatively short CT, tremendously useful for self-sustainability. 60 arts during Unlimited Blade Works is substantial.`,
                arts: `A teamwide shield with a total of 60k damage negated coupled with 30% teamwide physical resistance. The 10s duration is a bit low, but this gets extended to 20s while in UBW mode. Normally, you should not be dying with this up, barring exceptional circumstances.`,
                truearts: `Huge physical resistance debuff to help your other physical units hit much harder. In UBW mode, Shirou’s multiplier also becomes respectable, thereby helping him contribute to damage output.`,
                superarts: `First use makes Shirou enter UBW mode, which is similar to Magia Drive or Third Eye but costs 300 arts instead of 200 (though well worth it). Subsequent uses result in a high-multiplier arts with substantial ATK and DMG buffs. However, note that this does not make Shirou a main DPS, as he still gets outdamaged by most other units. This can help deliver a finishing blow to the enemy, but it should not distract Shirou from his main objectives which are to 1) keep the team alive, and 2) support the team’s damage output.`,
                ability1: `This passive is a good part of what makes Shirou so good, because the DMG RES buff not only lasts a full 3 minutes, but it also stacks with other units’ DMG RES buffs (e.g. Sanstone TA, Emperor Isliid TA, Fitoria NA, etc.). That means that you can maintain 60% teamwide DMG RES only from unit arts without the need to use a single defense equip. On top of that, Shirou gains paralysis and freeze resistance, which will enable him to keep doing his job, and as if this were not enough already, the devs decided to also give him periodic chip damage which, while not significant, is still a nice added touch.
                `,
                ability2: `Marginally useful passive against dark enemies, but not enough to really matter in the grand scheme of things.`,

                ability4: `Somewhat useful for reaching level 120 faster, but nothing too spectacular.`,
                ability5: `Another marginal benefit, but reaching UBW faster is always useful.`,

                    skill: `Mediocre defense equip off-unit with a low-duration sizable DMG RES buff and a fairly low CT. On Shirou, the duration doubles to 20s (57% uptime), making his True Weapon one of the best general defense equips in the game. Note that you need at least 75% EQCT buff to make TW Rho Aias full-uptime.`,
                    ability1: `100 arts on start of the quest, which helps reach UBW faster, along with a skill CT buff which will help with artgen from skill.`,

                overall: `The prize of the Prisma Illya collab, Shirou combines some of the best teamwide mitigation currently available to outstanding damage support. When he is on a team, the chances of dying decrease dramatically (with proper gameplay), making him a mainstay for most hard content. Although he is capable of DPS with a crit buffer, it is not his main role, and being too greedy with his SA might result in not being capable of keeping up with his defensive role.`,

                skill: `Large amount of artsgen on skill with a fairly short cooldown time. Since Saber should always be critting, that’s 80 arts per use`,

                truearts: `Huge self damage buff paired with a very sizable Dark Res down debuff, and on top of that, it has a decent multiplier (For non-Ascendable units of course).`,
                superarts: `Enormous multiplier paired with high super crit rate. This along with her True Arts, and by virtue of being a Dark Human unit is what makes Saber Alter the uncontested Best DPS and even Nuker on Global.`,
                ability1: `100% passive crit rate, pretty much a given with most good DPS units. The HP condition isn’t very intrusive either, so you shouldn’t have any issue maintaining it. However, the same can't be said for the status ailment condition. In any stages where this might be an issue, it might be a good idea to bring consistent cleanse or a replacement for the lost accuracy. Or just put Karks to negate the issue entirely.`,
                ability2: `Not very useful in the grand scheme of things. 40% extra resistance is cool, but niche and unnecessary in 99% of cases.`,
                ability3: `High HP requirement for a very small buff. It’s helped somewhat by Saber’s high base ATK, but it’s still a rather minor damage buff.`,
                ability4: `Helps you level past 90 a bit faster, but otherwise it’s nothing special.`,
                ability5: `A very small arts buff, but appreciated nonetheless.`,

                    skill: `It’s her bis for nuking, but when it isn’t on Saber it’s completely overshadowed by other buffing equipment like Simon TW and Bushido Master.`,

It's great for said nuking, and amazing for sustain since the larger buff is on her passive, hugely buffing her crit and super crit damage. Due to how much of a damage buff it provides, it's definitely worth picking up for her.`,

                overall: `Saber Alter is the worst unit in the Fate collab. This isn't because she’s bad at what she does-- She’s likely the best DPS and Nuker on Global. Rather, it’s because outside of her pseudo-heal on NA, she contributes nothing to the team besides damage, which makes her for the most part, replaceable by any other dps unit. This effectively means that any team that clears a mission with her on it can already three-man the mission anyway, albeit while taking longer. With content becoming increasingly difficult, this means that it’s going to be harder to use units that only do one thing and more important to have units that can fill multiple roles at once, which unfortunately, Saber doesn't do. She’s still amazing for nukes, and anything that doesn’t directly counter her will still be shredded. But just keep in mind that your pities should be saved for units that can fulfill multiple roles well, allowing for more flexibility in endgame content.`,

Additionally, The physical damage resistance is slightly devalued due to many bosses being a mix of magic and physical damage dealers, but less damage is still less damage.

That being said you’ll almost never use this since you wouldn’t want to lose your TA/SA stacks to something a heal equipment can handle.`,

Although this looks like a big number, Milim’s breaking capabilities are heavily hurt due to a lack of break power up and no break res down.`,

Nothing much other than a big number and unfortunately Milim lacks a significant amount of DMG Up by herself so this can result in unfulfilled expectations.`,

                overall: `Combat Form Milim tries too hard to be both a Breaker as well as a DPS and in doing so she suffers in both. Aside from her passive, she has no innate breaking or damage buffs to aid her. Not only does she require time and loads of art to ramp her TA or SA, she has very little self artsgen, even with her TW. It goes without saying that she can do very well if supported properly, but that’s the same for any other unit. Bringing a dedicated breaker or a DPS that have the abilities to complement their own role will serve better than trying to get Combat Form Milim to do either.`,
