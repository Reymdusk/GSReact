        lore: `It is one of the two swords that the lady swordsman Yomi carried when she drifted ashore to Raktehelm from another world. For many years, the soul of her friend swordswoman who was asleep in the sword didn't approve of those who attempted to wield it. It sat unused until the third princess of Bamint unleashed the dormant power of "Sakura Itto-Ryu". The sparkle of the blade fills the air like flowers from another world and the opponent, intoxicated from the scene, is slashed without even noticing.`

It was created with secret techniques passed down throughout generations of Giants. It is not only hard enough to break any blade that strikes it, but also can absorb its power--as well as the power of any magic attacks--and store them as heat within it. Its horns were red hot from the helmet's magic, as well as the Giant's own flames, and as such was used as both a piece of armor and a weapon. With the helmet decorated with scorching horns on his head, he burned swarms of foreign invaders to a crisp, becoming the absolute defense of the domain.`
